# Code Review Skill

Comprehensive code review covering quality, security, architecture, and UI/UX aspects.


## Instructions

- **Fully** read and understand the **Workflow Rules, Guardrails and Guidelines** section in CLAUDE.md before starting work, including but not limited to:
  - **Foundational Rules and Guardrails**
  - **Foundational Development Guidelines and Standards** (e.g. Development, Architecture, UI/UX Guidelines etc.)
- **Non-modifying** - Analysis only, no code changes
- Follow project guidelines from CLAUDE.md
- Use checklists in `checklists/` subdirectory for systematic assessment


## Workflow

### Phase 1: Context Analysis

1. **Determine review scope** from conversation context:
   - If specific files/dirs mentioned: Focus on those
   - If PR number mentioned: Run `gh pr diff <number>` to get changes
   - If focus area mentioned (security, architecture, ui): Emphasize in Phase 2
   - Otherwise: Use git status/diff for scope
2. Run `git status --porcelain` and `git diff` to identify changes
3. Run `git log -10 --oneline` to understand recent commits
4. Use `tree -d -L 3` and `git ls-files | head -250` for codebase overview
5. Identify applicable review types based on changed files (code, architecture, UI/UX)
6. Read additional relevant guidelines and documentation (API, guides, reference, etc.) as needed

**Gate**: Scope determined, relevant files identified


### Phase 2: Review Execution

Perform applicable reviews using the checklists. 
**Always** delegate specific reviews/analysis to suitable **sub-agents**, and execute in **parallel**.

#### Code Analysis
- Run static analysis, linting, type checking per project guidelines
- Use IDE diagnostics if available
- **IMPORTANT**: Only format code that has been added or modified, **NEVER** format the entire codebase

#### Code Review
**Checklist**: [CODE-REVIEW-CHECKLIST.md](checklists/CODE-REVIEW-CHECKLIST.md)

Assess:
- Correctness, logic errors, edge cases, error handling
- Readability, naming, code organization
- Best practices, DRY, design patterns, anti-patterns
- Performance (N+1 queries, algorithms, caching)
- Maintainability, testability, documentation, tech debt

#### Security Review
**Checklist**: [SECURITY-REVIEW-CHECKLIST.md](checklists/SECURITY-REVIEW-CHECKLIST.md)

Assess:
- Input validation & sanitization
- Injection prevention (SQL, command, XSS, path traversal)
- Authentication & authorization
- Cryptography (encryption, hashing, key management)
- Data protection (secrets, logging exposure)
- API security, headers, CORS, CSRF
- OWASP Top 10 coverage

#### Architecture Review
**Checklist**: [ARCHITECTURAL-REVIEW-CHECKLIST.md](checklists/ARCHITECTURAL-REVIEW-CHECKLIST.md)

Assess:
- CUPID principles (Composable, Unix philosophy, Predictable, Idiomatic, Domain-aligned)
- DDD patterns (bounded contexts, aggregates, domain events)
- Pattern adherence (clean architecture, service boundaries, API design)
- Anti-patterns, performance, scalability, resilience

#### UI/UX Review (when applicable)
**Checklist**: [UI-UX-REVIEW-CHECKLIST.md](checklists/UI-UX-REVIEW-CHECKLIST.md)

Assess:
- Visual quality (layout, typography, color/contrast, responsive)
- Usability (5-second clarity, touch targets, cognitive load)
- Platform conventions (iOS HIG, Material Design, web standards)
- Accessibility (WCAG 2.2), performance, interaction patterns

**Gate**: All applicable reviews complete


### Phase 3: Analysis & Findings

1. Categorize findings by priority:
   - **CRITICAL**: Security vulnerabilities, data loss risks, broken functionality
   - **HIGH**: Performance issues, maintainability concerns, minor security issues
   - **SUGGESTIONS**: Improvements, optimizations, enhancements

2. Identify obsolete/temporary files and code requiring cleanup
3. Check for unmotivated complexity, over-engineering, or duplication
4. Verify adherence to project guidelines and patterns

**Gate**: Findings categorized and validated
