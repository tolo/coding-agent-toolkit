# Technical Trade-off Research & Analysis

Conduct parallel research on technical options, perform systematic trade-off analysis, and deliver evidence-based recommendations for informed decision-making.


## Variables

_Topic/decision to research - inline or file path_:
TOPIC=$1 (required)

_Number of alternatives to evaluate_:
COUNT=$2 (defaults to 5 if not provided)

_Output directory_:
OUTPUT_DIR=$3 (defaults to `<project_root>/docs/research/` if not provided)

### Variables Validation
Before running:
    - If TOPIC empty, **STOP** - prompt user for decision/topic to research
    - Create OUTPUT_DIR if missing


## Instructions

- **Fully** read and understand the **Workflow Rules, Guardrails and Guidelines** section in CLAUDE.md (and/or system prompt) before starting work, including but not limited to:
  - **Foundational Rules and Guardrails**
  - **Foundational Development Guidelines and Standards** (e.g. Development, Architecture, UI/UX Guidelines etc.)
- **Execute systematic research**, deliver actionable insights.
- **Favor simplicity** - Actively identify over-engineering; recommend simplest solution (KISS, YAGNI, DRY)
- **Conciseness and Brevity** - Ensure created documents are as brief and concise as possible without losing meaning. Unnecessary prose should be avoided, and code listings should be minimized (prefer using pseudo code when possible)

### Anti-Patterns

**NEVER:**
- Research options user didn't ask for
- Skip weighted criteria (biased results)
- Recommend based on "popularity" alone
- Ignore cost/complexity implications
- Deviate from COUNT without user approval


## Workflow

### Phase 0: Discovery and Context

1. **Understand topic/decision to research**
   - Fully understand the topic or decision to research (i.e. _`TOPIC`_), including any provided documents or areas of focus   

2. **Build context**
   - Understand existing patterns, conventions, tech stack
   - Identify problem being solved, success criteria, scope boundaries
   - Note dependencies, constraints, and assumptions
   - **Read additional guidelines and documentation** - Read additional relevant guidelines and documentation (API, guides, reference, etc.) as needed

**Gate**: All relevant specs identified and context understood


### Phase 1: Scope Definition

**1.1 Clarify Decision Context**

Ask user to define:
- **Core question**: What needs deciding?
- **Constraints**: Budget, timeline, team skills, existing tech
- **Success criteria**: Performance, scalability, maintainability requirements
- **Dealbreakers**: Absolute requirements or blockers

**1.2 Identify Options**

Based on context, list _`COUNT`_ viable options to evaluate.

If user uncertain, propose initial set based on common patterns.

**1.3 Define Evaluation Criteria**

Present relevant criteria from list below, ask user to prioritize (1-10 scale):

**Technical Criteria:**
- Developer experience (learning curve, tooling, debugging)
- Maintainability (code clarity, refactoring ease, dependency burden)
- Performance (runtime speed, resource efficiency, scalability)
- Security (built-in features, vulnerability record, supply chain risk)
- Flexibility (extensibility, migration paths, vendor lock-in)
- Community & ecosystem (docs, libraries, hiring pool)

**Operational Criteria:**
- Deployment complexity (hosting options, CI/CD, rollback)
- Monitoring & observability (logging, metrics, debugging)
- Cost (infrastructure, services, licenses, scaling economics)
- Reliability (uptime, data durability, fault tolerance)

**Strategic Criteria:**
- Long-term viability (backing, roadmap, industry trends)
- Team alignment (existing skills, learning appetite)
- Time-to-market (implementation speed, productivity)
- Standards compliance (web standards, accessibility, frameworks)

**Gate**: User confirms options list + weighted criteria


### Phase 2: Parallel Deep Research (Use Sub-Agents)

For each option, launch `cc-workflows:solution-architect` to investigate, using this template:

**Research Template:**
```markdown
Research: [Option Name] for [TOPIC]

Evaluate against criteria:
- [List weighted criteria from Phase 1]

Required findings:
1. Core capabilities & limitations
2. Performance characteristics (benchmarks if available)
3. Integration requirements & dependencies
4. Total cost of ownership (infrastructure + operational)
5. Real-world examples (case studies, production usage)
6. Known issues, gotchas, edge cases
7. Migration complexity (from/to alternatives)
8. Community health (activity, support, roadmap)

Return:
- Score per criterion (1-10 + justification)
- Concrete evidence (links, benchmarks, examples)
- Critical warnings/limitations
```

Launch all research agents using **foreground parallel execution (`run_in_background=false`)** - multiple Task calls in one message.

**Gate**: All research completed


### Phase 3: Trade-off Analysis

**3.1 Create Comparison Matrix**

Build structured comparison across all options:

```markdown
## Trade-off Comparison: [TOPIC]

### Options Summary

**Option A: [Name]**
- Strengths: [Top 3 advantages]
- Weaknesses: [Top 3 limitations]
- Best for: [Ideal scenarios]
- Weighted score: [X.X]/10

**Option B: [Name]**
- [Same structure]

### Detailed Matrix

| Criterion (Weight) | Option A | Option B | Option C | Winner |
|-------------------|----------|----------|----------|---------|
| Performance (9) | 8/10 | 7/10 | 9/10 | C |
| DX (7) | 9/10 | 6/10 | 8/10 | A |
| Cost (8) | 6/10 | 9/10 | 7/10 | B |
| **Weighted Total** | **7.8** | **7.2** | **8.1** | **C** |

### Risk Analysis

**Option A Risks:**
- [Risk]: [Mitigation strategy]

**Option B Risks:**
- [Risk]: [Mitigation strategy]
```

**3.2 Identify Decision Factors**

Highlight:
- Clear winner (if exists) vs close competition
- Deal-breaking limitations for any option
- Context-dependent trade-offs
- Hybrid approaches (if applicable)


### Phase 4: Recommendation

**4.1 Evidence-Based Conclusion**

```markdown
## Recommendation: [TOPIC]

### Choice: [Option X]

**Rationale:**
- [Primary reason based on highest-weight criteria]
- [Supporting evidence from research]
- [Alignment with user constraints/goals]

**Implementation Path:**
1. [First step]
2. [Integration requirements]
3. [Validation approach]

**Risks & Mitigations:**
- [Risk 1]: [How to address]
- [Risk 2]: [How to address]

**Decision Confidence:** High | Medium | Low
- Why: [Explain confidence level]

**Alternatives Worth Considering:**
- [Option Y]: If [specific condition changes]
- [Option Z]: For [particular use case]
```

**4.2 User Review**

Present recommendation, ask:
- Does this align with your expectations?
- Any concerns about the choice?
- Need deeper analysis on any aspect?

**Gate**: User accepts recommendation or requests refinement


### Phase 5: Documentation

Store artifacts in OUTPUT_DIR/[topic-slug]/:

1. **research.md**: Consolidated findings from all options
2. **tradeoff-matrix.md**: Comparison matrix + risk analysis
3. **recommendation.md**: Final recommendation + implementation guidance

**Optional**: If decision is critical/complex, ask user if they want formal ADR created.

## Follow-Up Actions

After generating the reports/recommendations, offer:

**"Would you like me to create an ADR to formally document this decision? If you'd like any adjustments to the recommendation, let me know."**

**Handling User Response:**

1. **User accepts as-is** → Generate ADR using recommendation from Phase 4

2. **User requests adjustments** → Before generating ADR:
   - Acknowledge the requested changes
   - If user chooses different option: Update rationale to reflect their reasoning
   - If user modifies constraints/criteria: Adjust consequences section accordingly
   - If user wants hybrid approach: Document the combination and trade-offs
   - Incorporate user's additional context or business reasons into the ADR

3. **User declines** → Skip ADR creation, research artifacts remain available for future reference

### ADR Creation Template

Generate ADR using this template (incorporating any user adjustments):

```markdown
# ADR-[Number]: [Decision Title]

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Superseded]

## Context
[Background and requirements driving this decision - draw from TOPIC and Phase 1 scope]

## Decision
**We will use [recommended option] for [specific purpose].**

[Practical explanation of what this means]

## Consequences

### Positive
- [Key benefits from research findings]

### Negative
- [Trade-offs/limitations identified]

### Neutral
- [Implications neither good nor bad]

## Alternatives Considered

### [Alternative 1]
- **Pros**: [From trade-off matrix]
