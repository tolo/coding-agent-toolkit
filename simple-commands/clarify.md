# Clarify Requirements
Transform incomplete requirements into complete, actionable specifications through systematic discovery of gaps, edge cases, and scope boundaries.


## Variables

_Requirements to clarify (**required**):_
INPUT: $ARGUMENTS

_Output directory for clarified requirements:_
OUTPUT_DIR: `<project_root>/docs/specs/`


## Instructions

- **Make sure `INPUT` is provided** - otherwise **STOP** immediately and ask user for input
- **Fully** read and understand the **Workflow Rules, Guardrails and Guidelines** section as defined in AGENTS.md, etc. before starting work, including but not limited to:
  - **Foundational Rules and Guardrails**
  - **Foundational Development Guidelines and Standards** (e.g. Development, Architecture, UI/UX Guidelines etc.)
- **Interactive process** - Ask questions iteratively; don't assume answers
- **Be thorough** - Challenge assumptions, find edge cases, identify ambiguities
- **Stay focused** - Clarify requirements, don't design solutions
- **Document decisions** - Record rationale for scope choices and trade-offs


## Workflow

### 1. Parse and Assess Input

1. **Parse INPUT** - Determine type: inline description, file path, or URL
   - If file path: Read and extract requirements
   - If URL: Fetch and extract requirements
   - If description: Use directly

2. **Identify requirement type**
   - **New application/MVP**: Full product scope needed
   - **Feature addition**: Bounded scope within existing system

3. **Initial assessment** - Document:
   - What's explicitly stated
   - What's assumed or implied
   - What's missing or unclear

4. **Gap identification** - List gaps in:
   - Functional requirements
   - User flows and interactions
   - Edge cases and error handling
   - Success criteria
   - Scope boundaries

**Gate**: Assessment complete with documented gap list


### 2. Discovery Interview

Ask targeted questions based on identified gaps. Ask 3-5 questions at a time, iterate until no major gaps remain.

**Scope & Boundaries**
- What's explicitly IN scope?
- What's explicitly OUT of scope?
- What's the minimum viable version?
- What can be deferred to future iterations?

**Users & Flows**
- Who are the users? What roles/permissions?
- What's the primary user flow (happy path)?
- What alternate paths exist?
- What's the expected user journey?

**Edge Cases & Errors**
- What happens with invalid input?
- How to handle network/service failures?
- What are the boundary conditions (max/min values)?
- How should errors be communicated to users?
- What about concurrent access scenarios?

**Success Criteria**
- How do we know this is done?
- What are the acceptance criteria?
- What metrics define success?
- How will this be tested/validated?

**Dependencies & Constraints**
- What external systems/APIs are involved?
- What technical constraints exist?
- What data/integrations are required?
- Are there timeline or resource constraints?

**Gate**: All critical questions answered, no blocking ambiguities


### 3. Consolidate Requirements

Structure all findings into comprehensive requirements document:

1. **Summary** - 2-3 sentences: what, who, core value
2. **Scope definition** - In scope, out of scope, MVP boundary
3. **Functional requirements** - Core flows, alternate paths, user stories
4. **Edge cases** - Scenarios with expected behavior
5. **Error handling** - Error types, messages, recovery actions
6. **Non-functional requirements** - Performance, security, accessibility
7. **Success criteria** - Testable acceptance criteria
8. **Dependencies** - External systems, integrations
9. **Open questions** - Any remaining items for later phases

**Gate**: Requirements document complete and structured


### 4. Validation

Review consolidated requirements for quality:

- [ ] All user flows have clear steps
- [ ] Edge cases identified with expected behavior
- [ ] Scope boundaries explicit (in/out)
- [ ] Success criteria specific and testable
- [ ] No contradictions between requirements
- [ ] Dependencies documented
- [ ] No vague terms without definitions

Fix any issues found before finalizing.

**Gate**: All validation checks pass


## Report

```

Store report in: `OUTPUT_DIR/<feature-name>/requirements-clarification.md`

Inform user of report location when complete.


## Follow-Up Actions

After completion, ask user if they'd like to:
1. Proceed to PRD creation (`/prd`)
2. Create implementation plan
3. Review specific areas in more depth
4. Share with stakeholders for validation
